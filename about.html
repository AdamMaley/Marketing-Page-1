                    <p>I am currently an Assistant Animal Technician at The University of Utah, which has my heart but my
                        main passion is for coding. I took 2 years of computer electives in high school, where I learned to
                        code and used that knowledge as a hobby on my Myspace page. My other hobbies include gaming and
                        fostering homeless animals through Caws.
